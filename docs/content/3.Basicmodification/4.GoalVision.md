The path is as follows:

        "description": "A general description of your application goals."
      }
    ],

        "title": "The first goal: a short title",
        "description": "Average description of the mentioned goal",
        
        "isOpen": false

## Explanation of the amendment
### File partitions

This file is divided into three different sections:

- **SectionOne**: you will find the title and description of the objectives
- **GoalList**: Here you will find a list of objectives
- **SectionTwo**: Here you will find a description of the vision
The editing process is straightforward.

After opening the modification file as mentioned earlier, follow these editing steps:

- To change the data, edit the text within the quotation marks (**OBJECT ADDRESS**). For instance, you can modify the title to "New Title" and the description to "New Description."

| OBJECT ADDRESS  | THE CONTENT BEING MODIFIED  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| **Section 1**  | **SectionOne**  |
| title  | TITLE: Goal and vision  |
| description  | A general description of your application goals. |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| **Section 2**  | **GoalList**  |
| title  | One goal: a short title  |
| description | Average description of the mentioned goal  |
| isOpen  | false |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| **Section 3** |  **SectionTwo** |
| vision  | Your vision for which the application was launched |

Every time you want to add a new goal, you can copy this code, however, it is recommended to have a maximum of 4 goals
::code-group
  ```bash [goalvision.json > GoalList]
    ,{
      "title": "",
      "description": "",
      
      "isOpen": false
    }
  ```
