The path is as follows:

::alert{type="info"}
content > api > herosection.json

You will find this content:

::code-group
  ```bash [content > api > herosection.json]
  {
    "title": "HERE YOU CAN ADD A SHORT AND COARSE DESCRIPTION OF THE VISITOR",
    "description": "Here you can add a medium-length description, and the font is medium-sized",
    "user": "Here put short description about the app users"
  }
  ```

::code-group

  {
    "title": "",
    "description": "",
    "user": ""
  }
  ```

- To change the data, edit the text within the quotation marks (**OBJECT ADDRESS**). For instance, you can modify the title to "New Title" and the description to "New Description."

|OBJECT ADDRESS   | THE CONTENT BEING MODIFIED  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| title  | Here you can add a short and coarse description of the visitor  |
| description  | Here you can add a medium-length description, and the font is medium-sized  |
| user  | Here put short description about the app users  |
