1. Open the "content" folder.
2. Open the "api" folder.
3. Open the "features.json" file.

The path is as follows:

::alert{type="info"}
content > api > features.json
::

You will find this content:

::code-group
  ```bash [content > api > features.json]
  {
    "SectionOne": [
      {
        "title": "Key Features",
        "description": "A general description of your application features"

## Explanation of the amendment
### File partitions

This file is divided into three different sections:

- **SectionOne**: you will find the title and description of the features
- **FeaturesList**: Here you will find a list of features
The editing process is straightforward.

After opening the modification file as mentioned earlier, follow these editing steps:

- To change the data, edit the text within the quotation marks (**OBJECT ADDRESS**). For instance, you can modify the title to "New Title" and the description to "New Description."

| OBJECT ADDRESS  | THE CONTENT BEING MODIFIED  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| **Section 1**  | **SectionOne**  |
| title  | TITLE: Key Features  |
| description  | A general description of your application features. |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| **Section 2**  | **FeaturesList**  |
| title  | One features: a short title  |
| description | Average description of the mentioned feature  |
| icon  |Put the appropriate icon for the features |

Every time you want to add a new feature, you can copy this code
::code-group
  ```bash [features.json > FeaturesList]
    ,{
      "title": "",
      "description": "",
      "icon": ""
    }
  ```
::

- Once you finish the edits, save the file by clicking on "File" in the upper-left corner. Then choose "Save" or use the shortcut Ctrl + S (on Windows) or Command + S (on macOS).

Now you can observe the changes you made in your application when you reload or run it.
::alert{type="info"}
If the page does not refresh, you may need to refresh the web page

### Icons
When dealing with icons, you need to use an external website that contains various icons.

1. You can visit the following website: https://www.flaticon.com/uicons/interface-icons

2. Upon reaching the website, you can use the search box to type the name of the icon you're looking for or any related keywords.

3. Once you find the appropriate icon, you will find a code that represents it. Copy this code, and you can use it in your application. As an example, here is the code for the home icon: fi fi-rr-home

::code-group
  ```bash [Edit icon]
    {


      "icon": "fi fi-rr-home"
    },
  ```
