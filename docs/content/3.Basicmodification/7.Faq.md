## Targeting
The Help Section is a simple section that resembles a help center. In this section, you can gather the most frequently asked questions and issues that users may encounter, along with their corresponding answers.

This section includes:

- **Section Title**: Clearly states the purpose of the section as a user support resource.
- **FAQ List**: Contains a list of questions, where each question can be expanded to display the corresponding answer when clicked.
- **Email Address**: You can include an email address for communication in case the user's specific issue is not covered in the FAQ list.

The Help Section serves as a valuable resource to assist users and provide quick solutions to common inquiries. This enhances user satisfaction and ensures a seamless experience while navigating and using the application.

## Track
The term "path" here refers to the main JSON file in the API directory used to modify component content.

You can access the editing file by following these steps:

1. Open the "content" folder.
2. Open the "api" folder.
3. Open the "faq.json" file.

The path is as follows:

::alert{type="info"}
content > api > faq.json
::

You will find this content:

::code-group
  ```bash [content > api > faq.json]
  {
    "SectionOne": [
      {
        "title": "You ask? we answer"
      }
    ],
    "FaqList": [
      {
        "title": "Post a question here: How can I ...",
        "description": "The answer to the question is here: Getting started is easy!.. ",

        "isOpen": false
      },
      {
        "title": "Post a question here: How can I ...",
        "description": "The answer to the question is here: Getting started is easy!.. ",

        "isOpen": false
      },
      {
        "title": "Post a question here: How can I ...",
        "description": "The answer to the question is here: Getting started is easy!.. ",

        "isOpen": false
      },
      {
        "title": "Post a question here: How can I ...",
        "description": "The answer to the question is here: Getting started is easy!.. ",

        "isOpen": false
      },
      {
        "title": "Post a question here: How can I ...",
        "description": "The answer to the question is here: Getting started is easy!.. ",

        "isOpen": false
      }
    ],
    "SectionTwo": [
      {
        "email": "you.email@gmail.com"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

## json file original (API)
What is meant here is the content of the original file is empty, here you can copy the content of the file in case any information or content is lost or to verify.
::code-group
  ```bash [faq.json]
  {
    "SectionOne": [
      {
        "title": "You ask? we answer"
      }
    ],
    "FaqList": [
      {
        "title": "",
        "description": "",

        "isOpen": false
      },
      
    ],
    "SectionTwo": [
      {
        "email": ""
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

## Explanation of the amendment
### File partitions

This file is divided into three different sections:

- **SectionOne**: you will find the title
- **FaqList**: Here you will find a list of faq
- **SectionTwo**: Here you will find a email

After opening the modification file as mentioned earlier, follow these editing steps:

- To change the data, edit the text within the quotation marks (**OBJECT ADDRESS**). For instance, you can modify the title to "New Title" and the description to "New Description."

| OBJECT ADDRESS  | THE CONTENT BEING MODIFIED  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| **Section 1**  | **SectionOne**  |
| title  | TITLE: You ask? we answer  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| **Section 2**  | **FaqList**  |
| title  | One faq: a short title  |
| description | Average description of the mentioned faq  |
| isOpen  | false |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| **Section 3** |  **SectionTwo** |
| email  | you.email@gmail.com |

Every time you want to add a new faq, you can copy this code
::code-group
  ```bash [faq.json > FaqList]
    ,{
      "title": "",
      "description": "",
      
      "isOpen": false
    }
  ```
::

- Once you finish the edits, save the file by clicking on "File" in the upper-left corner. Then choose "Save" or use the shortcut Ctrl + S (on Windows) or Command + S (on macOS).

Now you can observe the changes you made in your application when you reload or run it.
::alert{type="info"}
