2. Open the "api" folder.
3. Open the "download.json" file.

The path is as follows:

::alert{type="info"}
content > api > download.json
::

You will find this content:

::code-group
  ```bash [content > api > download.json]
  {
    "title": "Short description of the section",
    "description": "Medium description of the section and the application maybe",
    "googlePlayLink": "#",
    "appStoreLink": "#",
    "reviewsDescription": "The number of reviews and ratings"
  }
  ```
::

## json file original (API)
What is meant here is the content of the original file is empty, here you can copy the content of the file in case any information or content is lost or to verify.
::code-group
  ```bash [download.json]
  {
    "title": "",
    "description": "",
    "googlePlayLink": "#",
    "appStoreLink": "#",
    "reviewsDescription": ""
  }

## Explanation of the amendment
The editing process is straightforward.

After opening the modification file as mentioned earlier, follow these editing steps:

- To change the data, edit the text within the quotation marks (**OBJECT ADDRESS**). For instance, you can modify the title to "New Title" and the description to "New Description."

|OBJECT ADDRESS   | THE CONTENT BEING MODIFIED  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| title  | Short description of the section  |
| description  | Medium description of the section and the application maybe  |
| googlePlayLink  | The link to the application or '**null**' if the application is not available in the store  |
| appStoreLink  | The link to the application or '**null**' if the application is not available in the store  |
| reviewsDescription  | The number of reviews and ratings  |

With regard to links, for example, if your application is only available on the Google Play Store, you can put the link and you can put the word **null** in the Apple Store, the Apple Store icon will disappear from the site

- Once you finish the edits, save the file by clicking on "File" in the upper-left corner. Then choose "Save" or use the shortcut Ctrl + S (on Windows) or Command + S (on macOS).

Now you can observe the changes you made in your application when you reload or run it.
