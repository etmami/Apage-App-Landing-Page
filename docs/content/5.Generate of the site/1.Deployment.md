# Deployment
## Understanding Static Hosting:

When we talk about static hosting, we simply mean providing a fixed location on the internet where you can store and display your project permanently and continuously. This implies that your project will be accessible to the public at all times, and you won't need to run your own server.

## Deploying a Nuxt 3 Project:

The process of deployment involves transferring your project from a development environment to a production environment, where users can access it as a public website. Let's explain how to do this using Nuxt 3.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Project

Before we begin, make sure your project is ready for production. Edit the content and thoroughly test it in your development environment.

### Step 2: Build the Project

 Open the Terminal within VSCode by clicking on View in the top toolbar and selecting Terminal from the dropdown menu.
::alert{type="info"}
View > Terminal
::
- In the Terminal, type the command **npx nuxi generate** and wait for generate 

```bash
npx nuxi generate
```

After that, all the project files will appear in the `dist` folder.

### Step 3: Hosting the Project

Here comes the role of hosting the project on a static hosting service. You can use services like Netlify or Vercel for this purpose. Start by creating an account and a new project on one of these services, or any other similar service listed below.

### Step 4: Uploading the Project

After creating an account on the hosting service, you can copy all the contents of the `dist` folder to the hosting service you've chosen. Typically, these services provide a user-friendly interface for uploading and configuring your project files.

### Step 5: Linking Your Domain (Optional)

If you have a custom domain, you can link it to your hosted project. This will make your project accessible through your own domain name.

### Step 6: Testing and Verification

Once your project is uploaded, either connect your domain or use the link provided by the hosting service to access it. Make sure your project works correctly in the production environment.

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed your project on a static hosting service. Your audience can now access and use your project permanently on the internet. Always remember to update and test your project when making new changes.
