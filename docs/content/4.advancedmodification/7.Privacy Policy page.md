## Markdown Basics

1. **Headings:**
   To create headings, use hash symbols (`#`). You can use one to six hash symbols to specify the heading level.
   
   ```
   # Heading Level 1
   ## Heading Level 2
   ### Heading Level 3
   ...
   ###### Heading Level 6
   ```

2. **Normal Text:**
   You can write normal text as usual. To make text bold, use double asterisks `**` or double underscores `__` around the text. For italic text, use a single asterisk `*` or a single underscore `_`.

   ```
   This is **bold text** and this is *italic text*.
   ```

3. **Lists:**
   You can create ordered and unordered lists. For ordered lists, use numbers and for unordered lists, use dashes.

   ```
   Ordered List:
   1. Item 1
   2. Item 2
   3. Item 3

   Unordered List:
   - Item 1
   - Item 2
   - Item 3
   ```

4. **Links:**
   You can add links using square brackets for the text and parentheses for the link itself.

   ```
   [Link Text](Page Link)
   ```

5. **Images:**
   To add an image, use the same approach as links and provide an image description after the link.

   ```
   ![Image Description](Image Link)
   ```

6. **Formatting:**
   You can add formatting such as emphasis (`<em>`) and underline (`<u>`) using a single asterisk `*` and underscore `_` consecutively.

   ```
   *Italic text*
   _Italic text_
   <u>Underlined text</u>
   ```

7. **Quotes:**
   To indicate quotes, use the greater-than symbol (`>`).

   ```
   > This is a quoted text.
   ```

8. **Code:**
   You can highlight code by using backticks (`) around the text.

   ```
   This is `code`.
   ```

9. **Tables:**
   You can create tables using pipes `|` for column separators and dashes `-` for row separators.

   ```
   | Header 1  | Header 2  |
   | --------- | --------- |
   | Content 1 | Content 2 |
   ```

These are some of the basics for using Markdown formatting. You can follow these rules to create easily comprehensible and well-formatted documents.
