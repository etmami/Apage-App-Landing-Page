# Colors and brand

You can easily customize your website's colors using Tailwind CSS and your configuration file. This allows you to adjust the primary and secondary colors to match your brand's identity. It's important to consider color coordination for a beautiful and consistent appearance.

## Steps

### Step 1: Open the Configuration File

Start by opening your project's Tailwind CSS configuration file. This file is typically located at `tailwind.config.js`.

### Step 2: Define Colors

In the configuration file, you'll find a set of properties related to colors. To define the primary and secondary colors, you can modify the `colors` properties. For example:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        basic: '#2C3E50', // Primary color (dark)
        secondary: '#ECF0F1', // Secondary color (light)
      },
    },
  },
  // ...
}
```
Initially, you'll notice that the properties are defined with default colors.

### Step 3: Formatting and Consistency

When changing colors, make sure that the primary and secondary colors are coordinated and work well together. You can use online tools to ensure color harmony.
