# The pictures

The project contains a total of 4 complete images, and the most important images that need to be changed are as follows:

- Logo
- App screenshot for phone cover
- Download section image

In the project preview, the same screenshot image used for the app is also used for the download section. Changing this is optional.

There are other secondary images that can be changed, but it's not recommended.

All images are located in this path:

`assets > img > ...`

## Changing Images

### 1. Logo:
   It's necessary to change the logo image for the website, and here are some tips:
   - The logo can also be used as the application's icon and even as the favicon.
   - The image format should be PNG.
   - The size of the image shouldn't be large; it should match the size it will appear on screens, preferably.

   To change the logo, navigate to the path:
   `assets > img`
   Find the current logo image named `logo.png` and replace it with your logo image. Make sure the filename and format match.

### 2. Welcome Image:
   The welcome image is the first image that appears when visiting the website. It contains a screenshot of the application within a smartphone mockup or frame. To change it, follow these steps:
   - Prepare a screenshot image from within the application.
   - Delete the current welcome image in the path: `assets > img`.
   - Replace it with your image, naming it `appimg.png`. Make sure to follow the same steps as mentioned above to ensure the filename and format are correct.

### 3. Download Section Image:
   The download section image is the same as the welcome image. Changing it is also optional. To change it, follow the same steps as mentioned above for the welcome image, but replace it with your image named `downloadimg.png`.

Save and preview the project after changing the images, and you will see that the images have been updated.
