# Favicon
## Favicon Description:
The favicon is the small icon that appears in the browser tab when a website is opened. The favicon helps distinguish your website from others and highlights its visual identity.

## Steps to Modify the Website Favicon in Nuxt Project:

1. **Choosing an Appropriate Image:**
Before starting, select a small image that represents your website well and aligns with its identity. For instance, a logo. It's important that the image is sized 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels and in ICO format to ensure the quality and clarity of the icon.

There are various online tools available to convert images to the ICO format.

public > favicon.ico
